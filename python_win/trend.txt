		  2）A deleveraged program may return only 20% but is 10 times more likely to 
		     survive a price shock, a much better long-term alternative. A small 
                reduction in returns for a larger reduction in exposure is a good trade-off.

	**分控调整头寸，从而影响策略表现。如果根据策略的特点去选择风控，那么风控的目
标就变了。因此，不同的风控目标可选不同的策略，从这个角度上，策略的好坏不能以简单的回
测结果做标准。所以策略买卖才会有意义。**1073
	**一般加减仓的范围是确定的，那么从整体来看，它的风险范围是可估计的，那么叠加的策略集合仍可以被看作一个策略。根据波动率调整仓位，特征是风险的稳定性，也就是这个组合策略的风险特征。
	**基于策略的止损比基于风控的止损更合理。每个步骤都可以从风控和策略两方面去考
虑，显然基于策略的更合理，但是可能伤及风控。如何折中？

	**1）The fast market is the result of developing news or an economic report where everyone has the same interpretation of the direction that prices should move. In futures this may be combined with a supply/demand imbalance or a perceived imbalance. Once a large number of buy orders flood the market, specialists, market makers, and locals all stand aside (or widen the bid-asked spread and offer very small quantity) rather than be run over
2）In the inactive market, a large premium must be paid to attract another trader to take the opposite side

	**1)Larger profits rather than smaller profits because it leaves more room for execution error.

		**Measuring only the drawdowns is a concept similar to semivariance and is valuable because the distribution of profitable returns compared to losing returns is not sym- metric; therefore, the standard deviation does not express it correctly and may bias the results in favor of profitable days, giving you an understated picture of risk.

		**adjusting the position size to target the same risk on 
each trade gives each trade an equal chance to participate in the 
results. Unless you can select which trades are most likely to be 
better than another, equal risk is the most conservative approach. 
Reducing the position size when the market gets more volatility also 
prevents the volatility of returns from varying wildly.
	**内在的初始风险
		**Each trading style has its own intrinsic risk associated with initial entries. The trend philosophy is known for its
 tenacity, entering a long position whenever prices turn up, taking a small loss if prices then turn down, and reentering the next time 
they turn up. The breakout technique will limit losses to the size of the current trading range and any attempt to reduce this loss, 
which can be large in a volatile market, conflicts with the essence of the method. Mean reversion systems must take large losses in 
exchange for a high percentage of smaller, profitable trades
	**止损
		**Using random numbers, the number of times reached multiplied by the size of the stop will always be constant. Then a stop must be better than a random event to be a good trading rule.
		**On some level, it makes sense to scale your losses to 
the amount of money at risk, but stops are more sensible if they 
relate to the nature of the system, the timing of the trade, the 
market volatility, or a chart pattern
		**So stops work as you planned most of the time, except when you need them most.

		**An alternative is to reduce the size of your positions as volatility increases.**#red
		**This concept of equalized risk (and perhaps reward) across all markets is very popular; 
however, it is not sensitive to individual markets, and as with many stops, it imposes artificial overrides. 
If the volatility of one market increases or decreases faster than others, then this risk level would need to 
be adjusted to individual mar- kets; otherwise, it could be reached on every trade or not reached at all.
	**止盈
		**Profit targets are essential in short-term trading, 
where the price noise makes it likely that any favorable move will 
reverse soon. They are more difficult to incorporate into a longer-
term trend-following system because they risk miss- ing the bigger 
profit (from the fat tail) in exchange for smaller but more frequent 
profits. As a trend-follower, once you take profits but the trend 
direction is still intact, you need to find a way to reenter that 
trade to avoid missing the rare, but very large price move.
		**While any profit target assumes that prices will not continue in the same direction,
		**Once the profit target has been hit, the system waits for the next trend trade. It cannot reenter the same trend
		**多个出场价格。并非是分步减仓，而是当某个风险条件触发的时候，

		**If volatility causes a sharp drop followed by a recovery, then hitting a stop captures the worst exit. On the other hand, 
if volatility gives you a windfall profit, then exiting that position will be a good move.if they are triggered by intraday price 
movesYou would want to exit at the time of the intraday spike rather than waiting for the end of day.
	**滑点
		**in fast markets, you are lucky if your stop is executed near your price. Often it gets filled 
		  at the extreme of the move, where all the buyers and sellers cluster.
		**When many stop orders cluster around the same point, there is proximity risk. One way this 
can be seen is in a gap as price breaks through a key resistance level. Given the large number of trend-
following systems, it would not be surprising to find that many of them are generating the same orders on the 
close, especially following a very volatile price move.（下单价格要灵活）
