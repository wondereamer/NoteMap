**进场的三种方式
	**Buy the entire amount at the time of the signal.
	**Average into the position (or some weighted average).
		**When averaging into a trade, if the trend changes direction 
before the full position is set, then the loss on the trade will be less than 
if you had entered all contracts on day 1. On the other hand, if prices were 
to move steadily higher after a new long signal, then the average entry price 
will be worse than day 1
		**每隔固定的天数间隔加仓，总仓位在初始阶段是确定的。
		**噪音越到，效果越好。
		**The total time to enter should be proportional to the speed of 
the trend or the average holding period of the trade
		**很难套用于反向系统。
		**there seems to be an overall improvement in trend-following 
results.
	**Wait for a better price
		**We see that waiting, even for a minimum move pullback after 
the initial signal, re- sults in a significant improvement in performance。
		**To avoid the worst-case scenario of missing the biggest 
profit, we can enter at the close if no op- portunity has occurred within 5 
days。
		**cut the number of trades by about 40% in all three markets. 
This shows that there are many trend trades that lasted only a few days, and, 
because of waiting for a better price, the trend turned back in the previous 
direction, and the false signal was not taken.没有进场说明回调打破了原来的信号，
可能不仅仅是价格回调。
		**Using Timing for a Better Price。Long positions will be entered 
after the initial signal, or at the time of the initial signal, if the RSI is 
below a threshold level set at 30. a maximum window will be used to avoid 
missing a trade. The RSI will be 8 days rather than the default 14 days in 
order to find more opportunities within the window.
	**加仓
		**几种加仓图。**1101
		**Adding equal amounts on new high profits with a minimum number 
of days separating the entries
		**Adding half the previous size with the same conditions as 
above。
		**Adding equal amounts on new losses with a minimum number of 
days between entries.
			**成功率不高，可能和股票的健壮性有关，底子好的股票跌幅有限。

	**资金趋势交易
		**Increasing position size as equity increases during a trending 
period always results in being fully invested at the top of the cycle, when 
losses begin. Losses will be on a larger base than profits, and equity will 
drop much faster than it increased。
		**A sustained losing streak may cause a speculator to reduce the 
investment in proportion to dwindling capital. If this happens, the result 
will be entering into a profitable period with a smaller investment than the 
prior losing period
		**his method would perform poorly on a diversified portfolio, 
which should have shorter periods of negative movement。you should first find 
out if the returns are positively autocorrelated, meaning that there is 
persistence in either positive or negative returns. You must also consider 
that applying this to hypothetical equity patterns is not likely to work 
because hypothetical results are always better than actual trading results。
		**三种不同的现金管理方式。**1105
	**最优投资
		**The objective is to maximize the amount invested (put at risk) 
yet avoid the possibility of a loss greater than some target amount。For an 
initial investment, optimal f is simply the maximum part of that portfolio 
that can safely be traded without any significant risk of ruin。
		**For those investors who withdraw profits as they occur and 
continue to trade based on the same assumed initial investment, nothing need 
be changed unless exceptionally high risk requires a decrease in the amount of 
leverage。
		**复原功式： gain=1/(1-loss) - 1
50% loss requires a 100% gain to restore the original value
		**if you invest less than the optimal amount, then your risk 
decreases arithmetically, but your profits decrease geometrically, which is 
another bad scenario.
		**The drawdown during a trade could be much larger than the 
final outcome of that trade. Then there is more risk than can be seen using 
only the final trader result.杆杆再调整，更接近实际**1111
